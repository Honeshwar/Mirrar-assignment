# Design a Weather Forecast Dashboard

## Description

In this task, you are required to design a single-page weather forecast application using any public API of your choice (for example, OpenWeatherMap API).

## The user should be able to:

1. Enter a city name and view the current weather details of the city, which include:
   - Current temperature
   - Minimum and maximum temperature
   - Humidity
   - Wind speed and direction
   - Description of the weather (e.g., clear sky, light rain, etc.)
   - An appropriate icon reflecting the current weather

2. View a 5-day forecast for the selected city, displaying:
   - Date
   - Average temperature
   - Description of the weather
   - An appropriate weather icon

3. View these details in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. Include an option for the user to toggle between these units.

## Technical Requirements
- The application should be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and ReactJS.
- The application should be responsive, looking good on both desktop and mobile.
- The application should be user-friendly and intuitive, with clear error handling. For example, if a user enters a city name that doesn't exist, there should be an appropriate error message.
- The code should be well-structured, maintainable, and follow best practices.


## Submission Guidelines

- You should submit your code in a public repository on a version control system like Github.
- Include a README.md file with instructions on how to run the project locally.
- Include a link to a live version of your application for easy reviewing. You could use platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or Github Pages to host your application.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality: The application works as described without any bugs.
- Code quality: The code is easy to understand, well-organized, and follows best practices.
- UI/UX design: The application is easy to use and aesthetically pleasing.
- Responsiveness: The application looks good on both desktop and mobile.
- Error handling: The application handles potential errors gracefully.

This task will help us evaluate your understanding of frontend technologies, your ability to write clean and maintainable code, and your attention to UI/UX design principles. Good luck!
